Hello Bubbleconf, we got your female engineers
===============
We don't believe we need to stress the need for more diversity in Tech. What we'll do instead is explain how Rails Girls and all other beginner workshops, Summers-of-Code and study groups help lower the barrier for new comers to the industry. Plus, we'll show how girly details can make all the difference in creating a safe environment and one of playful learning. No blaming the boys, a lot of pointers how you can help introducing more people to our ever emerging industry.
