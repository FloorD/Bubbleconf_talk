##DATA! (FD)
**114 Rails Girls workshops** have taken place worldwide. So far we've collected data from 54 events, which actually gives us a nice idea of the background of both the organizers and the participants.  
**9 out of 54 main organizers is male**. **4 out of 14 coaches is female** (it's something!) **5591 applicants for 54 registered events** (Ljubljana received 586 applicants). The **average age of the attendees** is 27, the youngest attendee being 10 years old and the oldest 70. The organizers come mainly from a CS background, though ‘Design’ and ‘Education’ also pop up.  
28% kept on coding in some way. Both in Berlin and in the Netherlands there’s even a program in place.

*Special thanks to Verena Brodbeck for collecting these preliminary results.*  

#####Before we move on we would like to note that we are two Rails Girls supporters, we don't speak on behalf of Rails Girls as a whole.  Rails Girls in itself is a very diverse group of people, so it would be close to impossible to form an opinion about whatever Twitter fittie is going on atm. So let's not waste precious Q/A time on this. Thanks! 

##The Rails Girls story - how it developed. (HK)

What is this Rails Girls thing? Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community. The first event, held in Helsinki in November 2010, got over 100 interested girls signed-up for the workshop. Our aim is to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. We do this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.  
[Henrietta](http://twitter.com/phenriettak) is a member of the global Rails Girls team, taking care of business in Europe. Then there's [Satu Suuronen](http://twitter.com/satusuuronen) in Finland and [Linda Liukas](http://twitter.com/lindaliukas) and [Karri Saarinen](http://twitter.com/karrisaarinen) of the founding team.  
Since the first workshop in 2010 the free events have expanded to Shanghai, Singapore, Tallinn, Berlin, Krakow and many more attracting thousands of girls to the world of web building. The community took ownership. 

###Hi
My name is **Henrietta** ...

My name is **Floor Drees**. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management. Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. Little later my company supported me to work as a junior developer one day a week, mainly documenting bugs talking to marketing and communication, and actually fixing bugs.   
I organized Rails Girls Rotterdam in January, [Rails Girls The Hague](http://railsgirls.com/thehague) 3 weeks ago, I co-organize the [Ruby user group meetups in Vienna](http://vienna-rb.at) and the [PyLadies workshops in Vienna](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vienna/). I currently work at [Usersnap](http://usersnap.com) and spend the little time that is left coaching at Rails Girls events and helping out where I can when it comes to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).

###What is this workshop we're talking about?  (FD)
Rails Girls offers [guides](http://guides.railsgirls.com/) in all shapes and sizes. There's the 'how to organize a Rails Girls Event' guide, a guide to install Rails, the Rails Girls app, several follow-up guides (like adding thumbnail pictures, or commenting),  guides to put the web app online with Engine Yard, Heroku, pushing to GitHub, a how-to for attendees looking to continue with programming and how to become a Rails Girls coach.  

A typical program looks like this: 
**Typically on a Friday evening** we host the Install Party. Attendees can drop by and get help installing Rails and Sublime on their computers. The party part usually consists of some nice tunes, bubbely wine, snacks (PIZZA!) and a lot of chatter. I really like this part of the Rails Girls workshop as attendees and coaches get to know each other and are usually more relaxed with asking questions the following day. Additionally, a lot of our coaches are busy people and this is usually the first time they meet 'in the flesh'. You'll see them exchanging what kind of students they'd like to coach and where they could trouble-shoot (for instance 'anything Linux related', or regarding JavaScript or Rails 4 specific behavior).  

They **next day** starts with a healthy breakfast - and a lot of coffee (really, you have NO idea). Then we'll have an introduction and the infamous Bentobox exercise where the attendees learn some tech talk, or more importantly: how to Google for stuff. Depending on the organizing team you'll have lightning talks after the Bentobox exercise, right after lunch, or at the very end of the workshop - which is usually around 5pm.

In the mean time groups of 3-5 attendees, grouped by level of experience (and os), depending on the coach-student ratio, start with the workshop. They will craft a web app that let's you create, list and store ideas. They'll need to use so-called scaffolding to get up and running, and there is a lot of terminal (or command prompt) action needed. They'll learn about ERB, the model-view-controller relation, Twitter Bootstrap and databases. 

By the end of the day most groups completed the main app, along with some follow-up guides and proudly shared their Heroku apps on Facebook.

###What makes beginners join our community?  (HK)
- Open sourced learning  
- Learning programming by yourself can get quite boring. And lonely.  
- The 'girl effect'  

###Ever improving on guides and workshop outlines.  (FD)
With every Rails Girls workshop I co-organize, or coach at, I learn a little more about the ideal setup of such an event. Like: how to divide the attendees into groups in which they can really focus on learning (and have a little fun along the way). Laura and I created a tutorial that teaches beginners what the terminal is capable of, for Rails Girls Bratislava. The [next iteration](https://github.com/FloorD/ninjanine/blob/master/tutorial.md) was already part of the intro talk at Rails Girls The Hague.  

Another great thing that came out of Rails Girls Bratislava, is [THE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/FloorD/ninjanine/blob/master/cheatsheet.md). Andy, Tony, Laura and I talked a lot about the errors attendees run into, that we could try to avoid – or we can help seem less scary. One way to do that of course is to add documentation to the Rails Girls tutorial, but then there’s a fine line between being explicit – and cluttering the guide with information that is superfluous for many attendees. In our cheat sheet we run through a check list. Did you save your changes? Did you restart the server? Are you working in the correct directory? Did you run bundle? Did you check for typos in your code? Etc. With the bonus question being: are you using Rails 4? ;) We encourage the attendees to take a deep breath, scroll up and read the error, Google it, and when it doubt ask their coach for help.  

The guides are also subject to constant change. Often you'll find a coach (or a bunch of coaches) hacking on the guides because an explanation or code example is outdated. The guides are all open source, which makes it easy to just create a pull request and have your change approved by other people who just want to improve the material, just like you.   

In the end it comes down to this: different people learn in different ways. We can’t optimize for everyone, but there’s definitely room for improvement on the Rails Girls workshop. I don’t know all the solutions. I learn something new and encounter whole different errors at every event.  

###How to contribute (translations, follow-up guides, sponsorship, coaching, ... )  (FD)
- write translations  
Guides have been translated in Japanese, French, Chinese, Russian, Brazilian-Portuguese and Spanish, and those are the ones that have been added to the program. I bet there are some translated copies flying around somewhere. 

- write follow-up guides  
- commit to a (long-term) sponsorship  
- volunteer as a coach  
- organize an event in your city 
- ...  

The great thing about this community is that some coaches travel miles to help out at a workshop in a different city or country, and many organizers are happy to have them as they're already confident with the Rails Girls material. Plus: I've seen Rails Girls alumni volunteering to coach, and organizers (like [Karla Schönicke](https://twitter.com/karlawithakey)) traveling over 7 hours to help organize Rails Girls Brno. 

##Girls that kept coding (HK)
Krakow example

##Rails Girls Summer of Code (FD)
One of the best things that evolved out of Rails Girls (so far) is probably Rails Girls Summer of Code. Anika Lindtner - in my eyes the First Lady of Rails Girls Summer of Code - will go into more detail on the subject in her lightning talk later today, but let me tell you this: Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source. Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students are paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code - right away).  
Women who fell in love with programming, for instance at a Rails Girls workshop, could apply and spend their summer coding fulltime. Rails Girls Summer of Code provides 10 sponsored teams and - I believe - 8 volunteering Teams with the chance to dive deeper into coding and to get in touch with the amazing Open Source community. On top of that it gives the Rails Girls movement a longer-term goal of supporting women in technology and role models: Being the first Rails Girls students who make meaningful contributions to projects like Rails, Sinatra, Bundler, Spree.

###No no boys club (FD)
I'd like to stress that all beginners are allowed to participate, but when more people apply than we have space for, women are first.  
Obviously, with a name like Rails Girls we don't get a lot of applications from men, but female applicants often ask me if they can bring their boyfriend or co-worker who expressed that they want to learn coding as well. At Rails Girls The Hague we even had an all male group and they were just as excited about the Rails Girls branded tote bags, stickers and kitten references as their fellow students.   

##What's in it for you as a coach?  (FD)
First: it’s awesome to help people. Next: I strongly believe teaching makes you a better programmer. Because teaching will accelerate your own learning. They will ask you things you’d otherwise take for granted. And you’ll need to be able to actually explain it in a way they can grasp it. I love how I remember stuff that my mentor would try and have me do - like inspect everything on a page, even if I was basically begging for the answer, after 3 hours of coding. This would frustrate me to no end, but looking back it’s one of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned. 

Teaching at a Rails Girls event keeps you grounded. Not everyone has an idea of what HTML of CSS is. Nobody cares about your favorite editor (the best editor ever is whatever you are comfortable with using). Or os. God forbid most of them doesn't even know what vc stands for ;)

You'll meet a lot of amazing people (both students and fellow-coaches). During the install party and lightning talks you can share your project and/or passion, and more often than not I found coaches exchanging GitHub accounts and hack on projects together during breaks. 

I've heard some pretty amazing stories from organizers of local chapters, when asked for their motivation to set up such an event. One of the main organizers from Rails Girls Brno ([Jan](https://twitter.com/jankolario)) wanted to learn to code himself. Some organizers are tired of being the only woman at tech conferences and hackathons. Many others just want to spread the joy of programming (Ruby).

I planned for Rails Girls Rotterdam to take place 6 months after I started learning programming. When I really want to learn something, I need to have this motivation, a certain amount of stress somehow. If I really wanted to organize this beginners workshop, I had better make sure that I had my basics covered by then - at the very least. This date - January (18 &) 19, was motivation enough to skip out on a lot of social events and spend all my free time going through Rails tutorials - and Avdi Grimm's books ;)

##How could you contribute to your community?  (HK)

##Encourage hiring junior developers - why?   (HK)

They will (hopefully) question everything  
They are eager to learn  
They are usually on top of the newest shit happening  
We don't all need Google level engineers. [Remember the level of the team should be commensurate with your challenges, otherwise you’ll risk spending a lot of time hiring a team that leaves shortly after starting due to a relative mismatch of programmer skill to engineering challenge.](http://blog.petesoder.com/blog/2013/09/23/why-engineering-pr-is-not-crazy-talk/)  
A compelling story for other newcomers
