##DATA!
INSERT: some of the stats Verena is gathering. cities, number of events, applicants, participants, coaches, level of experience etc. 
I think it would be cool to start with some data instead of the fluffy community story ;)

##The Rails Girls story - how it developed. 

What is this Rails Girls thing? Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community. The first event, held in Helsinki in November 2010, got over 100 interested girls signed-up for the workshop. Our aim is to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. We do this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.  

[Henrietta][1] is a member of the global Rails Girls team, taking care of business in Europe. Then there's [Satu Suuronen][2] in Finland and [Linda Liukas][3] and [Karri Saarinen][4] of the founding team.  

Since the first workshop in 2010 the free events have expanded to Shanghai, Singapore, Tallinn, Berlin, Krakow and many more attracting thousands of girls to the world of web building. Community took ownership. 

###Hi
My name is **Henrietta** ...

My name is **Floor Drees**. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management. Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. Little later my company supported me to work as a junior developer one day a week, mainly documenting bugs talking to marketing and communication, and actually fixing bugs.   

I organized Rails Girls Rotterdam in January, [Rails Girls The Hague][7] in September, I co-organize the [Ruby user group meetups in Vienna][8] and the [PyLadies workshops in Vienna][9]. I currently work at [Usersnap][10] and spend the little time that is left coaching at Rails Girls events and helping out where I can when it comes to Rails Girls Summer of Code.

###What is this workshop we're talking about?  
###What makes beginners join our community?  
Open sourcing learning.  
The 'girl effect'  

###Ever improving on guides and workshop outlines.  
###How to contribute (translations, follow-up guides, sponsorship, coaching, ... )  

##Girls that kept coding
Krakow example

###No boys club
I'd like to stress that all beginners are allowed to participate, but when more people apply than we have space for, women are first. 
 
##What's in it for you as a coach?

##Summer of Code
[Rails Girls Summer of Code][5] is made possible with the effort from [Travis Foundation][6]. Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source. Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students are paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).

A Summer of Code sponsoring 10 teams of students from all over the world working on Open Source projects full-time for three months. Sounds like a great idea? Why of course it does!

It's the idea of Rails Girls Summer of Code: To support women who fell in love with programming, for instance at a Rails Girls Workshop and want to spend their summer coding full-time. The idea was born in March, at a meeting of the Berlin Chapter of Rails Girls coaches and organizers. Because everybody was so fascinated by the idea, Sven gave a lightning talk at a Rails Girls Berlin workshop at Wooga in late March and the idea immediately spread like wildfire. A whole new team formed, rolled up their sleeves and started to build a project out of an idea. Rails Girls Summer of Code now provides 10 sponsored teams and 8 volunteering Teams with the chance to dive deeper into coding and to get in touch with the amazing Open Source community. On top of that it gives the Rails Girls movement a longer-term goal of supporting women in technology and role models: Being the first Rails Girls students who make meaningful contributions to projects like Rails, Sinatra, Bundler, Spree.

- Over 140 students applied from all over the world.  
- Over 280 people & companies donated for the campaign.  
- Sponsorships from amazing companies have sponsored the program. Amongst them community heroes like GitHub, 37signals, Tilde, Google Open Source, SoundCloud... And we are humbled to be included in this amazing list as well!  
- We raised $80,0000 in the first two weeks alone.  
- We were able to accept 19 students into the program so far. That's 9 more than the original goal which we thought was super ambitious already!  
- We managed to organize for the students no less than 49 free tickets to some of the best Ruby conferences on 3 different continents with awesome speaker coaches like Chad Fowler, Caroline Drucker, Konstantin Haase, Patrick Huesler, to name only few.
