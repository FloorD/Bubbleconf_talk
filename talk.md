##We got your female engineers

What is this Rails Girls thing? Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community. The first event, held in Helsinki in November 2010, got over 100 interested girls signed-up for the workshop. Our aim is to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. We do this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.

Since the first workshop in 2010 the free events have expanded to Shanghai, Singapore, Tallinn, Berlin, Krakow and many more attracting thousands of girls to the world of web building.

###Hi
My name is **Henrietta** ...

My name is **Floor Drees**. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management (notice the 'head of'? That addition is not there for swag reasons alone, I actually managed a team). Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. Little later my company supported me to work as a junior developer one day a week, mainly documenting bugs talking to marketing and communication, and actually fixing bugs. 

I organized Rails Girls Rotterdam in January, organizing [Rails Girls The Hague][7] in September, I co-organize the [Ruby user group meetups in Vienna][8] and the [PyLadies workshops in Vienna][9]. I currently work at [Usersnap][10] and spend the little time that is left coaching at Rails Girls events and helping out where I can when it comes to Rails Girls Summer of Code.

###No boys club
I'd like to stress that all beginners are allowed to participate, but when more people apply than we have space for, women are first.

###Summer of Code
[Rails Girls Summer of Code][5] is made possible with the effort from [Travis Foundation][6]. Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source. Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students are paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).
